### :earth_africa: About Me
I'm a Geographer by trade (MSc, specialization in GIS) who likes to code. Interested in all things GIS, data visualization, (big) data analysis and automating boring, repetitive stuff.

### What you'll find here
My projects are focused on areas where coding can make life easier.
Here is some more information about the pinned repositories:

#### Personal Projects

- [Travelling Map](https://github.com/taetscher/travels)
    - Personal project using [maplibre-gl-js](https://maplibre.org/) and QGIS to visualize my travels interactively. Features pop-ups linked to corresponding Wikipedia-articles.


- [handballStats](https://github.com/taetscher/HBS)
    - This is a personal project, where statistics of Handball teams playing in the highest leagues of the Swiss Handball Federation (SHV) are scraped from the SHV's website, then cleaned and [visualized interactively using GitHub Pages](https://taetscher.github.io/HBS/) and D3.js. It features automatic updates via a raspberry pi set up to scrape data in 45 minute intervals on Wed, Sat and Sun between 10:00am and 23:00pm.


#### Projects from University
- [Masters Thesis](https://github.com/taetscher/MastersThesis)
    - Here you can find a PDF of my Masters Thesis, which bears the title: _Bigger is Better. Or is it? Lessons learned from applying a deep neural network to Twitter posts in order to estimate potentials of using big data to monitor the UN Sustainable Development Goals._
    
- [ICARUS](https://github.com/taetscher/ICARUS)
    - Here you can find the coding repo of the above thesis. 
    
- [interactiveICARUS](https://github.com/taetscher/interactiveICARUS) 
    - [GitHub Pages page](https://taetscher.github.io/interactiveICARUS/) that interactively visualizes some of the results from my thesis using D3.js.
    
- [Volcanic Ash Plume Modeling](https://github.com/taetscher/2018-volcanic-ash-plume)
    - Student Project where we modeled the ash plume and air traffic hazard zones of the 2010 Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption.
    
- [Badewetterindex](https://github.com/taetscher/OpenData_taetscher)
    - Student Project where we calculated a "bathing weather index" for Switzerland and visualized it interactively with D3.js. Take a look at the [official Website](https://badewetter-index-schweiz.opendata.iwi.unibe.ch/)!

By the way, If you're wondering where my GitHub username comes from:
Back when I was a teenager, a good friend of mine came to see my handball practice. Since handball is a full-contact sport, one instance of such contact lead to a loud slapping sound (a ```taetsch``` in Swiss German) being dispersed in the gymnasium. Henceforth I would use this name for my online aliases, honoring my good friend.
